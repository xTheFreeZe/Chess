# Chess Game written in V

This is a simple chess clone written in V. It uses raylib under the hood for rendering.

## Building

Of course you need to have V installed. You can get it from [here](https://vlang.io/).

Once that's installed, you need to install raylib. V has a built-in package manager that can do this for you. Just run:

```bash
v install raylib
```

In the root of the project, run:

```bash
v . # To compile the project
```

or if you want to run the project directly:

```bash
v run . # To run the project
```
